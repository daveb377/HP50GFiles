 HP50G Files
I've been using my HP48/49/50G for years as an Electrical Engineer. I've downloaded many programs from HPCalc.org, although I started out with Comp.sys.hp48 in the Usenet days. I'm cleaning up some of the programs I've written to share. Not all of them are completed, but I took them to a point whaere they're usable.
